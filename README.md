# CV-sida

This is my first website with mainly utilizing flexbox to achieve its appearence. The startpage gives an overview of most of the content from the other pages in the navbar while also linking to them. Throughout the website a navbar and a footer persists to give a unified look while also being able to jump from page to page seemlessly. There are buttons and embedded links in headlines both linking to other pages on the website but also to other website on the internet entirely.
